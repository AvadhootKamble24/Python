its engaging multiplayer modes. 

However, some titles in the series also feature single-player 
story modes that follow a set narrative. 

These story modes typically involve a cinematic experience 
with cutscenes, voice acting, and interactive gameplay. The first Call of Duty game to feature a 
story mode was Call of Duty: Finest Hour in 2004'''
